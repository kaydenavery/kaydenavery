Hello! My name is Kayden Schwartz. I am currently a Master's student at Concordia University in Montreal, QC.

My interests include data science, machine learning, and environmental applications. The intersection of these topics fascinates me and I believe it has great potential.

I'm currently exploring more aspects of machine learning and deep learning as well as studying forest biodiversity in my MSc program.

I'm looking to collaborate on environmental topics, machine learning applications and especially any projects that invlove an intersection of the two!
