Hello! My name is Kayden Schwartz.

My interests include data science, machine learning, and environmental applications. The intersection of these topics fascinates me and I believe it has great potential.

I'm currently exploring more aspects of machine learning and deep learning.

I'm looking to collaborate on environmental topics, machine learning applications and especially any projects that invlove an intersection of the two!
